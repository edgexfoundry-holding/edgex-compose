This repository contains the docker compose files for EdgeX releases. 

> **Note:** Each release is now on it's own branch named after the release codename. You can view all branches [here](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-compose/branches/all).

This `branch` contains the `pre-release` docker compose files that pull and run the EdgeX images from the Nexus3 docker registry that are tagged with `master`. These images are built from the Edgex CI Pipeline when PRs are merged into the `master` branch.

> **Note**: Docker does not re-pull newer instances of these images. You must pull the new image instances. See the `make pull` command described below that will do this for you.

These `pre-release` docker compose files are generated from the multiple source compose files located in the `compose-builder` folder. See [README](compose-builder/README.md) there for details on regenerating these files after making changes to the source files. 



### Compose Tool

The Makefile in this folder expects the `docker compose` CLI command.
The old stand-alone `docker-compose` tool is no longer supported.
See https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ for installation details for the latest `docker compose` CLI command.

### Compose Files

This folder contains the following compose files:

#### Generated Compose files

> **NOTES: **
>
> - *DO NOT EDIT the files directly for permanent changes. Make all permanent changes to the source compose files in the `compose-builder` folder and then regenerate these files*
> - Use `make build` from `Compose Builder` to regenerate all the following compose files.
> - See each description for the convenience `make` commands that are provided to work with each of these compose files.

    - Use `make openziti-logs` to follow the logs
  
### TAF Compose files

The compose files under the `taf` subfolder are used for the automated TAF tests. These compose files are also generated from `Compose Builder` when the `make build` command is used.

### Additional make commands

- `make clean`

    Runs `down` command and removes all stopped containers, all volumes and all networks used by the EdgeX stack. Use this command when needing to do a fresh restart.
    
- `make get-token`
    For secure mode only. Runs commands via docker to generate a new API Gateway token.

- `make get-consul-acl-token`
  For secure mode only. Runs commands via docker to retrieve a Consul Access token.

### Additional compose files

- **docker-compose-portainer.yml**
    Stand-alone compose file for running Portainer which is a  Docker container management tool. Visit here https://www.portainer.io/ for more details on Portianer.
    Use `make portainer`and `make portainer-down` to start and stop Portainer.

### Use PostgreSQL as the persistence layer in EdgeX
EdgeX services can be configured to use PostgreSQL as the persistence layer. The compose builder now supports generating compose files that use PostgreSQL.

**To use PostgreSQL as the persistence layer, follow these steps**

- Go to `/compose-builder` folder
- `make run no-secty keeper mqtt-bus postgres`

    Runs the services with PostgreSQL as the persistence layer in non-secure mode.
- `make run keeper mqtt-bus postgres`

    Runs the services with PostgreSQL as the persistence layer in secure mode.

> **Note:** `keeper` and `mqtt-bus` are required services for EdgeX to run with PostgreSQL as the persistence layer.
